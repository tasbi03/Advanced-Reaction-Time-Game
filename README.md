# 🎮 Advanced Reaction Time Game

## What's All the Buzz About?
Welcome to the ultimate showdown of reflexes - our Advanced Reaction Time Game! 
🚀 Upgraded from a basic terminal-based version, we've now added some sound to the picture! 
Yes, you heard it right—buzzers!

## New Features
- **Buzzer Beater**: Why limit to visuals when you can have an auditory thrill? We’ve added a buzzer for that eureka moment when you beat the clock! 🎉
- **Sneaky Sensors**: No cheaters allowed! We’ve got motion detection sensors keeping an eagle eye on premature button pressers. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Learning Mode**: And it’s not just about fun. There's a learning mode for kids to learn while they play. Teaching reactions and reflexes can be fun too! 📚

## How We Did It
We took the feedback, rolled up our sleeves, and made these cool things happen:
- Tweaked some libraries to make the buzzer behave.
- Battled with an LCD that was playing hard to get, but guess what? We won!
- Integrated motion sensors for a no-cheat zone.
- Tailored an algorithm that chooses between an LED or a buzzer—making every round a surprise.
- Set up a score matrix that’s fair and square, so every millisecond counts.

## Playing the Game
1. Pick your game mode - Fun or Learning? 🤔
2. Enter the number of rounds - choose wisely!
3. Stay sharp - when the buzzer goes or the LED glows, hit the button, fast!
4. Don’t jump the gun, or it’s a score of none!

## For the Little Ones
In Learning Mode, kiddos get to answer math questions and improve their reaction time. And don’t worry, we mixed up the answer options—no patterns here!

## Behind the Scenes
Our coding dojo was all about:
- Creating a fair scoring system.
- Making sure everything was packed neatly in a box - because safety and design matter.

## The Endgame
After a fun (or brainy) session, we tally up the scores and voila! A graph appears, showing your reaction stats—a graph so cool, it makes numbers look fun!

## Future Forward
This game's just getting started. Think more questions, better hardware, and a game that grows with you.

## Credits
- **Tasbi**: The brain behind the buzzer and the keeper of the scores.
- **Madhur**: The code ninja and the motion sensor maestro.

## Total Hours Spent: 39.5 hours (and worth every second!)
